description: WCAG-focused accessibility analysis using visual and structural inspection
version: 1.0.0

inputs:
  url:
    description: URL of the running web app to scan
    required: true
  pages:
    description: Comma-separated list of paths to scan
    default: "/"
  level:
    description: WCAG conformance level to check against (A, AA, AAA)
    default: "AA"

steps:
  - id: scan
    agent: ui-vision:accessibility-scanner
    instruction: |
      Perform an accessibility scan of the web application at {{ url }}.

      Pages to scan: {{ pages }}
      Target conformance level: WCAG 2.1 {{ level }}

      For each page:
      1. Navigate to the page
      2. Take a screenshot for visual analysis (contrast, sizing, spacing)
      3. Get the accessibility tree for structural analysis (labels, roles, hierarchy)
      4. Tab through all interactive elements - note focus order and visibility
      5. Check against WCAG 2.1 {{ level }} criteria:
         - Perceivable: text alternatives, contrast, text resize, non-text contrast
         - Operable: keyboard access, focus order, focus visible
         - Understandable: labels, error identification
         - Robust: proper roles, names, values
      6. Rate each issue by severity

      Provide a detailed accessibility report for every page scanned.

  - id: report
    instruction: |
      Based on the accessibility scan results:

      {{ steps.scan.result }}

      Create an actionable accessibility report:
      1. Estimated conformance level (AA / Partial AA / Below AA)
      2. Critical issues that must be fixed (blocking for users with disabilities)
      3. Major issues that should be fixed (significant barriers)
      4. Minor issues (improvements for better experience)
      5. What's done well (positive patterns to maintain)
      6. Limitations of this analysis (recommend supplementing with axe-core, Lighthouse)
      7. Priority fix order (quick wins first, then high-impact changes)
